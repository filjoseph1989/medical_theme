## Medical School theme

From the company I am connected the development of this theme involved the two of my coworker,
we are ask to create individual design for a local medical school for health-care professionals website.
The client chose mine.

## Design
The first design was simple and the color is based on the school logo which is pink, purple and teal. Along
the development of the theme, the design slightly change and inspired with google material design. The layout
using Adobe Photoshop was converted first to purely html to get the original layout. And from the html layout it
was divided into header, content and footer and become a WordPress theme.

## Frameworks
The theme is using materialize grid, navigation and other components, it has a problem with the cards response
to different screen sizes that lead to the additional use of material design lite cards. The rest is a custom css
design with few jquery.

Tags, materialize, material design lite,
